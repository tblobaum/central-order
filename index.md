## The Central Order

### CHAPTER I  
IN THE BEGINNING the Universe started off with a Big Bang.  
The explosion formed into a Baum with two halves like your two palms.  
In orbit around that Baum, a Baum (galaxy).  
Around that Baum, a Baum (star).  
Around that Baum, a Baum (planet).  
Around that Baum, a Baum (river).  
Around that Baum, a Baum (tree).  
Around that Baum, a Baum (human).  
Around that Baum, a Stein (the son of man).

The torch forming in the hand of man is like the Sun forming around the Milky Way.  
The vine crawling up a tree is like a river crawling across the Earth.  

### CHAPTER II
THE GREATEST SECRET of the greatest inventor of all time is to put a thing on the end of a stick.  
Arm, Leg, Head, Fingers, Toes, Spoon, Spear, Torch, Stone, Fork, Paddle, Axle 

### CHAPTER III
GO OUT INTO THE SUN in the Morning, especially in the Spring.  
Avoid going into the Sun in the Evening, especially in the Fall.  
These are the teachings which bring long life.  
The rays of the Spring Morning are blueshifted.  
They are moving toward you faster than at any other time.  
The rays of the Fall Evening are redshifted.  
They are moving toward you slower than at any other time.  
Blueshifted rays stabilize your sub-atomic particles like a boat moving faster through the water.  
This stabilization propagates upward and impacts your DNA, cells, organs, body, family, community, your nation and the entire animal kingdom.  
The activity level of predators of all kinds is lowest during the sunrise and highest at sunset just as all the Universe follows along.  
You could say that we life-forms are nothing but an accumulation of countless years of blueshift.  
Japan has the highest average life expectancy among large nations and Japan is known as the Land of the Rising Sun.  

### CHAPTER IV
THE WEEK IS SEVEN DAYS LONG and has been since the days of Babylon.  
Our Babylonian ancestors made the decision for a 7 day week.  
The days of the week have gone in sequential order for thousands of years without missing.  
The week is 7 days long due to a supernatural cycle identified by the Babylonians.  
Everyone knows that life on Earth goes haywire on the Full Moon.  
Life also goes haywire on the New Moon, the First Quarter Moon and the Third Quarter Moon.  
Babylonians first observed the Sabbath Day to avoid bad luck on these days.  
To observe the Sabbath properly is to do so on the quarters of the Moon.  
In fact, the Sabbath should be observed every 6 to 9 days.  
These days create a supernatural cycle for man.  
Yet, woman is possessed by the Moon all the time.  
Men should stay at home or near a religious facility on the quarters of the Moon.  
Women need to stay home because the men have gone haywire.  
There is a supernatural cycle that lasts about 7 days for a man.  
On this day something memorable happens: up, down, left, right, forward, backward, inside-out.  
This weekly cycle is like going before a judge in a courtroom.  
One thing for certain is it will be memorable, and black and white.  
Deep inside the moon lives a being which, like your mind, is the Universe itself turned inside out with a heart set on fire.  
This being interacts with life on Earth, from the right, in seemingly irrational ways.  

### CHAPTER V  
THE CHINESE AND HEBREW calendars have a common Babylonian ancestor.  
The moon is full on the 14th day of every month in the hebrew and chinese calendars.  
A lunar cycle of 14 or 15 is also known.  
14 months is 420 days the approximate length of the cycle.  
The calendars use the 19 year cycle of the Moon.  
This cycle is known as the Golden Cycle.  
Every 19 years the Moon is in the same place.  
Out out 19 years, 7 have an extra month making them 19 days longer.  
Out of 19 years, 12 do not have an extra month making them 12 days shorter.  
Also, every 76 months a day is added to a random month somehow making 77.  

### CHAPTER VI  
EVERY 7 YEARS IS KNOWN as a Sabbath Year.  
On this year you might sell your investments.  
Once the markets have tumbled you consider investing again.  

### CHAPTER VII
EVERY 7TH SABBATH YEAR shall be known as a Jubilee Year.  
A Jubilee Year occurs every 49 years.  
You shall enact your plans at this time.  

### CHAPTER VIII
THE CREATOR IS LIKE the human, but more.  
It is like a mouse compared to a big wealthy man.  
Some believe that God is a human.  
When we observe sub-atomic particles it is observation alone which defines the universe.  
Given this, if a different intelligent being lead the way then our world would be very different.  
It might be somehow suited to them instead.  
The leaders of mankind defined the details of the universe over the eons.  
The Universe was fuzzy before.  
As our eyes evolved, so developed the details of the world.  
It is possible we inherited the universe from a different being which detailed it first.  
G-d is with the one with the most attention to detail.  
In any case, the Creator is like the human.  
Both are able to form things that did not exist before.  
The human evolving into a great creator is like a child growing up.  
The Creator made the universe long ago.  
Part of the purpose of the universe is to grow a new creator.  
You could tell how the human and the Creator are similar if you could see them both at once.  

### CHAPTER IX
TO MAKE SOMETHING into a woman is to turn it inside out and set its heart on fire.  
The man turned the woman inside out and set her heart on fire.  
This is what something powerful does in our universe.  
A blackhole is the universe itself turned inside out and set on fire.  
Your consciousness is also the universe turned inside out and set on fire.  
Men do this to each other’s cities and nations.  
Blackshirts in the geo-center of the United States were forged with this in mind.  
A house is also mother nature turned inside out with a hearth set on fire.  
This is what something powerful does to something else in our universe.  

### CHAPTER X
G IS THE 7th letter in the alphabet.  
G is for G-d.  
F is the 6th letter in the alphabet.  
F is for female.  
The number of the man is 777.  
A top man is born on 7/7 and turns 77 on 7/7/7.  
The number of the female is 666.  
April Fool’s Day is 66 days before 6/6.  

### CHATPER XI
FAHRENHEIT SAID a transition occurs at 31.4159 and 77.7 is ideal.  
Victor E Wager was 31 years 4 days when his daughter was born and turned 77 on 7/7/7.  

### CHAPTER XII
6/6 IS 1/1 TO 7/7  
6/6 is 11 days to Star Wars in '77  
6/6 is 22 days to 5/14 the birth of Israel  
6/6 is 33 days to May the Fourth  
6/6 is 44 days to 4/22

6/6 is 77 years to Normandy in 2021  
6/6 is 77 days then 14 days to 8/8  
6/6 is 8/8 to Valentine's Day  
6/6 is 999 days to 9/11  

### CHAPTER XIII
MEN CAN HAVE AT MOST about 77 children.  
Women can have at most about 6 children.  
Thus, a woman who is a hero has bad genes in the technical sense of the word.  
If half the men in our nation die, the future population of our nation does not have to suffer.  
If half the women in our nation die, the future population of our nation will be cut down.  
The woman cannot be trusted to save anyone but herself.  
A woman’s life is worth more than an average man’s.  
Yet, the leaders life is worth half the whole population, due to head games.  

### CHAPTER XIV
MEN ARE SMARTER than women.  
Men are also more stupid than women.  
There are more smart men than there are smart women.  
There are more stupid men than there are stupid women.  
More men have better hearing and eyesight than women.  
More men also have worse hearing and eyesight than women.  
More men are thinner than women.  
More men are also overweight than women.  
More men are taller than women.  
More men are also shorter than w-  
Long ago, there was a type of man who was shorter than his woman.  
His name was Bloom.  
Bloom was critical in the defense network of our species.  
Men are more and less than women.  
Due to this we can all trust the womb is safe.  
When an unknown deadly entity strikes humanity there will be men there to fight and die.  
No matter what angle the unknown deadly entity takes there will be men there.  
If the deadly force takes the lives of smart humans then the men will be there to fight and die.  
If the deadly force takes the lives of stupid humans then the men will be there to fight and die.  
If the deadly force takes the lives of those with bad hearing then the men will be there.  
If the deadly force takes the lives of those with good hearing then the men will be there.  

### CHAPTER XV
YOUR CARDIOVASCULAY SYSTEM looks very similar to your nervous system.  
This coincidence occurred because your heart is actually your oldest brain.  
Every time you stick your neck out to take a bite, a sight or a hear, your brain and sensory organs move away from your heart.  
Look at the snake, the greatest eater of them all, and he is all neck.  
Your internal organs are female and they do what is necessary.  
Your sensory organs are male and they lead the way.  
Of your arms and legs, the legs are female and the arms are male.  
The woman is a nice pair of legs and the man is a nice pair of arms.  
No man was ever attracted by a woman’s arms.  
Your legs do what is needed while your arms do what is difficult.  
Your stomach and kidneys do what is fundamental while your eyes and ears do the impossible.  
This is the nature of woman and man.  

### CHAPTER XVI
THE DOUBLE HELIX in the center of your cells.  
The Double Tree Hotel.  
The city that’s Dublin’.  
The Blackshirts in the center.  
The Twin Towers in the economic center.  
The gravitoelectromagnetic field of the stars and planets.  
The great two-faced story-teller in the greatest center.  

### CHAPTER XVII
ENCOURAGE YOUR ENEMIES to enjoy the Sunset.  

### CHAPTER XVIII  
Pyramid building leads to belief.  
Belief leads to freedom fighters.  
Freedom fighters lead to Zionism.  
Zionism leads to conflict.  
Conflict leads to diaspora.  
Diaspora leads to democracy.  
Democracy leads to diversity.  
Diversity leads to conflict.  
Conflict leads to pharaoh.  
Pharaoh leads to pyramid building.  

### CHAPTER XIX
IN THE HEBREW LANGUAGE one may turn little Ma around to make multiples (or people).  
This word is Am, which is the most commonly used word in the bible.   
You can also take little Ma, turn her around to make Am, and then attach to the ends of words to pluralize.  
Through careful consideration we can discover mankind's first words.   
Ba, Ma, Am, Baam, Maab  
Thumb, Index, Middle, Ring, Pinky  
Turn Ma around and put her together with Ba to make Baam.  
Baum is the family tree.  
Mob is one of the oldest words in the world.  
Mob simply means the family tree is going the other direction on you.
